# <img src="./public/assets/images/running-icon.png" width="30">Race Finder 

A web application to help match runners with races with a focus on simple, easy to use options. This application is for for the runner that is tired of staring at a long list of races and other events. (No more flag football and table tennis in the results.) A runner may simply enter a location, race distance, and range of dates to get back a short list of races most likely to interest the runner.
